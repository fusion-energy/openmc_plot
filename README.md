First you will need to [install OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html)

OpenMC_plot can then be install directly from the Python package index (PyPi) using pip.

```
pip install openmc_plot
```

# Usage

In the terminal type ...

```

Your default web browser should then load with the GUI.

You will also need to have [OpenMC installed](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html).
